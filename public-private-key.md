# What is?

Public and private keys form the basis of public key cryptography

* Is asymmetric cryptography
* A public key matches only one private key
* Public is used to encrypt
* Private is used to decrypt (and also encrypt)
* **IMPORTANT**: A message encoded with a public key can only be decoded by the private key

## What they are

In the end both are not keys but large prime numbers that are mathematically related to one another. 

Those numbers are generated by mathematical algorithms:
1. Rivest-Shamir-Adelman (RSA)
   1. Oldest public-private key cryptography
2. Digital Signature Standard (DSS)
   1. A Federal Information Processing Standard 
   2. Used by NIST (US GOV Agency)
3. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
   1. Use elliptical curves to generate
   2. Often used by digital signature

## Other points

1. Private key is faster than public/private key
2. public/private key is asymmetrical because there are two types of keys
